This is cool as now hearing about those technologies makes more sense. 

My goal for next year is to buy my own hardware and create my own websevers using apahe or nginx,  running my services in docker containers for my algorithms and backend LLMs as well as front end applications that I have.  That would be such a cool thing to do!

1324951a-feb1-49c0-a070-c750ba47ad4d,5/11/2024,RNN's Extended,"Today I furthered my knowledge on RNNs and Seq-2-Seq models.  Usually these models are made of an Encoder and a Decoder.  Also not here that when I model is unidirectional or bidirectional this is not referring to whether it is encoder or decoder or both, but uni/bi directional refers to the masking in the self and cross attention.

Bidirectional means no masking meaning words can attend to words both before as well as after then, and unidirectional meaning that words can only attend to words in one direction usually only those before it.

Okay back to RNN's and Seq-2-Seq with encoders and decoders the main objective with an RNN based Seq-2-Seq model is to use the encoder RNN to encode the sequence into a context vector then use the decoder to decode it into the output sequence.  

This can be thought of as similar to how an autoencoder words with images encoding into a latent space and then back.  We are able to leverage the RNNs to allow for arbitrary length inputs and outputs that can be the same or different length.

With the RNNs we usually layer them and have multiple cells per layer to increase the total number of parameters in the network allowing for more complex relationships to be learnt.   When training we don't use the predicted previous value for predicting the next we actually use the real previous value to ensure each gets trained fairly and isn't affected by previously bad predictions which would make training time exponentially longer, because we would have to wait for all previous values to get predicted 100% correctly before the next can be properly learned.

Next once that is done I want to upgrade the backend to use direct SQL statements with functions and triggers created in SQL in order to avoid using the ORM (object relationship napping) provided by supabase and really get hands on with my SQL for my career later down the line with data engineering.

I also want to add features like the habit tracker which would be super helpful as well as the private AI powered tutor making use of llama 3.2 models I host myself on azure etc.  

I also need to sit down and get the work history and project pages, as well as the about me and contact completed and looking crisp so I can continue developing all the features. 

Once most of that is completed the goal is to have built or have a powerful PC with a good graphics card and storage I can use as a private server, using tools like Apache, docker and Postgress in order to fully self host my project and setup as full CI/CD pipeline with GitHub actions as well as end to end testing with playwright and jest.

I will definitely need to sit down and review the content in the future but I think I will hold off until I have completed the entire course.
Today what I learned was the there are there main types of intervals we look at, tolerance, confidence and prediction.  Prediction intervals define our uncertainty or certainty in a models prediction, while confidence intervals focus on the certainty in a specific model parameter say the mean or std.
Mike provided a great diagram to understand the difference between the two of these.
With tolerance interval, I am still a little confused.  After a little more research, I think that I understand it more.  Essentially it looks at the observed values as a whole as opposed to a single prediction or a parameter like prediction and confidence intervals.  A tolerance interval makes a statement about the data as a whole e.g. 90% of all observations will fall between 10 and 20. I think it mkaes much more sense now.

37b4fe15-649d-4715-87af-97bee0045f8f,24/10/2024,Understanding Hydration,I just fixed a hydration error in the frontend code for this application and I really wanted to understand how this works as it is a problem i find myself facing a lot.  This isn't a problem in traditional react applications as all of the code is rendered on the client side.  But with Nextjs we have the ability to render parts of the code on the server before sending it to the client.  It is render on the server and then the HTML is hydrated on the client side with the javascript.  A hydration error occurs when there is a difference between what the server and the client render initially.  This can be solved by making sure if you are loading in something that you handle loading state on the server which can be done as the initial state of a use state variable is available on the server side but things like useeffect etc will not be until the client side so we need to make sure we return multiple different html tags based on the different situations so that what the server and client initiallly load is the same or else we are beating the point of having hydration.  Too be completely honest  I don't full understand the concept so I might make another post in the future in order to sit down and refine my knowledge,fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,frontend-learning,"[""https://jzlzzjcinqypqardzzfq.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/1729734402025_hydrationerror.png""]",,17

40a85031-8a7d-450c-88ed-3f8a32709034,5/11/2024,RNNs,"Today I found out the secret about RNNs.  All they really are is a single classification or regression network with a feedback loop.  So given an input it predicts the output than feeds that output back into the input.  Allowing us to save the hidden state through summation of inputs.  It’s conceptualised and shows as many networks working together but in reality it’s just a single network with a feedback loop. 

It is also cool to think about how it.  These networks are really good at predicting and forecasting future values using this cumulative hidden state.  But they do have issues with exploding and vanishing gradients as we need to compute back propogation through time. 

It is also interesting to note that as it’s really just one NN with feedback loops the weights for input and state transfer are the same for each which also makes sense as any word could appear in any position.  

In order to make RNNs better we can use LSTM or GRU.  These both leverage concepts such as gating in order to control what data and how much data is transferred between states.  LSTM has an input, forgot and update gates which are pretty self explanatory controlling what is carried from the previous state in input, what is forgotten in current state and what is passed to the output of next state. 

GRUs are a soldier and faster approach using just two gates update date and the reset gate.  Update acts as the input and output gates from LSTM and reset is single to the forget gate. 

When using attention and transformers we can avoid the need for having RNNs and feedback loops by using positional encoding when c
Encoding the words in the vector space to repress their sequence position. ",fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,machine-learning,[],,64

Namely Full-Stack Web Development, Data Analytics and Data Engineering.  If I have these skills and I am able to build applications that incorporate all three of these things with machine learning, cloud etc.  I will be more than ready to tackle the challenges of building a career as a data engineer to get my location and time freedom while doing a job I really really love. 

It is definitely not going to be easy at all but I think if I really just put my head down and trust myself and my plan over the next 8 months I will finish uni on a great trajectory to achieve my data engineering goal and easily be able to land an entry level role.  I am currently at level one, where the focus is on strong full stack development fundamentals, using Storm-Drain as a passion project to build these skills, while reading the full-stack react book I got.

Second thing I learned was the rel=“no opener no referrer” no opener means that the new page we have directed too does not have access to this pages window object and no referrer prevents the new page from knowing how it was navigated too these are a standard practice when opening to an external page website.
The other thing I learned today helped me to get the typing animation working on my about page in the way I wanted with it having breaks between the paragraphs this was done by utilising the leading-relaxed and white space-pre-line tags.  Leading relaxed affects the space between lines of text usually maki by it much easier for a user to read and white space pre line controls how white space is handled in html text it is great for getting the \n in your text to be actually displayed as it isn’t by default but it also cleans up other empty spaces as well.",fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,frontend-learning,[],,83

It was that in essence a lot of programming and software engineering is really about just understanding these made up protocols that were designed to bring consistency and allow everything to work.  Although algorithms can be much harder what I am trying to say is that a lot of the time in programming we are limited by how well we understand these made up protocols.

Which is a way is kind of empowering, like learning these protocols with the mindset of just understand how someone solved that specific communication problem is really interesting and a mindset I think will be helpful in my future learnings, for example sitting down and just learning exactly how sql was developed and how it works and all of logic behind the different functionalities allows for a richer understanding of the overall tool. 

Anyway what I am saying is that you can get very very far on just understanding protocols and languages as opposed to your logic and algorithmic skills. ",fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,general-learning,[],,67

85475127-0f9a-4a2c-83f2-f622ca314f61,28/10/2024,(Wk7) Information Retrieval Lecture Summary,"Today I recapped the lecture with Shane covering Information Retrieval Systems.  We began looking at the specific terminology that we would be using, that being query, document and collection.  With the query being the user query outlining what information the want to retrieve, the document being the base unit of information (It used to be actual documents but these days it is usually referring to a chunk of a document), and the collection is just all of the documents.  We also initially spoke about Precision and Recall in information retrieval systems and that in most cases recall is not that important as along as we get a right answer we don't need to get all of them.  But in some specific scenarios like law cases recall is very important as we would need to get all of the info. 

Next we spoke about Inverted Indexes and Postings Lists.  There are essentially a way of understanding which words appear in which documents.  The Inverted Index is a super large and sparse matrix that records how often each word appears in a document, with documents as the columns and words as the rows.  A postings list is a row in this matrix, that says for that specific term/posting how often it appears in each of the documents in the collection.  This is a FUNDAMENTAL DATASTRUCTURE in Information Retrieval and the building block for many of the traditional algorithms still used now. 

In order to make sure these postings lists are useable they are usually heavily compressed and computing the similarity score between a query and a document requires the uncompressing of all term posting lists for terms in the query.  In order to avoid having to do this we use a smart algorithm called WAND (Weighted AND).  For this algorithm we take our similarly metric say TF-IDF or most commonly BM25/BM25F (TF-IDF but better and also incorporate query and document normalisation to stop length of document from affecting the result as much) and for each term in the postings list we compute using our chosen metric the maximum score it receives from any document in the collection and call it Ut or the upper bound.  Now when we receive a query we create a min heap and a threshold theta.  We skip and document if the sum of its terms is less than theta to avoid having to uncompress and fully compute it, allowing us to save valuable time in our computation.  There are also usually layers to this, for example in block WAND in order to do even more filtering and avoid having to actually uncompress and compute and this is usually the first layer of most info retrieval systems and it works quite well! 

There are also some more practical considerations that we spoke about that being that we need to make decisions about whether or not to include stop words or not, as well as token normalisation so that we can avoid the U.S.A != USA != US != America problem when in theory we want all of them to mean the same thing.  We would also apply stemming and lemmatisation in order to simplify.  For stemming we discussed two kinds the first being the Porter Stemmer and the second being the Krovetz stemmer which Shane said was much better even though most people in theory say Porter is the best and that Krovetz is overengineered. 

We then moved onto looking at the Different BOW Rankings again talking about BM25 and BM25F which is sued for HTML.  Both using Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency as well as Query and Document length normalisation. We also spoke about LMDS as well but not in depth, the idea was the same thing in reverse, saying ""given a document that is this a query that it could have generated""  It's equation also used the same things in it as BM25.  Most systems these days use BM25, WAND, Inverted Indices for the initial retrieval and then Deep Learning for the reranking process.  

We next spoke about learning to rank and how the Bing Search engine works with their L0, L1, L2, L3, L4 levels of document filtering. We talked about the expensive cost of feature engineering and extracting feature from the data.  We next spoke about the concept of cascade ranking which means that we start looking at a few features when we have lots of docs and and increase the number and complexity as we filter more out to make the retrieval and ranking more efficient.  We specifically looked at cost aware feature extraction and Empirical Loss Minimisation where we start with large lambda and move to small lambda so less to more features.  We also spoke about how SGD was altered to work here with Hinge Loss which was interesting. 

We then moved on to Deep Learning and Dense embeddings, looking at some basic techniques with overlapping gpt and bert prompts and bubble sort and moved onto more advanced generative AI.  We talked about Dense Retrieval and the use of KNN in order to get our top K Documents after we embed the document and the query into a shared space allowing us to compute similarity scores. We talked about the concept of ANN (Approximate KNN) as well as the concept of negative sapling and choosing good quality negative samples in the model training. This led to the discussion about ANCE-Tele that uses ANN to find negative samples using dense retrieval which works but is increasingly computationally expensive especially using the process within itself again.  We saw that ANCE-Tele and BM25 both got relevant answers but not always the same answers and usually ANCE-Tele is a little better.  

Finally, we looked at Sparse vs Dense Retrievals with sparse being like inverted indices which many columns having 0's where dense has less features and is much richer with data and semantics but also much slower. But dense allowing multi/cross modal and sparse only really works for exact matches.  This is where SPLADE can in allowing a way to do term expansion to try and solve this problem and we looked at the Orangutan in Malaysia problem as an example.  SPLADE leverages token embedding and cosine similarity in order to find the similar terms and perform term expansion.  However SPALDE is very computationally expensive and we talked about how SPLADEv2 uses pooling in order to fix its smoothing problems.   That was basically it leading into next weeks topics of RAG.",fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,university,[],,34

Using a provieded research paper he outlined a relationship between the parkinsonias dry weight, its height and its diameter and if I rearrange these equations I may be able to get an equation that can tell me its height given its diameter.  

Then using this in combination with the systems current capabilities we can use this calculated height and calculate the maximum spreading distance for each of the parkinsonia within the image. 

This means we could do a system where we get the low, med, high, critical based on the percentage distance of the planets height.  For example no risk is distances greater than 100% of its height, low within 100% to 75%, medium within 75% to 50%, high within 50% to 25% and critical from 25% to 0%. Furthermore, another idea is to models the risk as a 3D normal distribution for the chance of spreading.""

Using the provided formulas of
W = 0.091D^3.04 
W = 0.025H^4.47

We can get that H = ((0.091D)^3.04/0.025)^(1/4.47) allowing us to calculate the height of the parkinsonia given its diameter.  The only Issue is that this is the canopy diameter but I think is this case it will be fine to do it this way ",fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,university,[],,55

This is why when studying I will endeavour to test myself on concepts daily with quizzes and fail as often as possible as every failure in training or prepartion is one less that will be made in the actual fight or exam.  So moral of the story is to fail often and learn from it.  Don't let you ego get in the way of progress.

Thus, instead I had to leverage a velocity use state and every frame the velocity was calculated as previous velocity - 9.8 * delta, and then the velocity would reset to 0 once the droplet returns to its initial state.

We then compared different models using two different way trying to control the model outputs to avoid harmful results.  The looked at nemo models which incorperate guarding into the training and focus on removing the harmful info from the model so it does not know the answer, the other we used was guarding which tries to deal with guarding after the model has generated a response.  What we found was that nemo worked much better as well as the olf lamma guard worked better than the new version.  The biggest takeawayss was that llama.cpp and quantisation allow you to run models on normalish hardware and still get great results and that guarding through the nemo method and limiting what the model actually knows is much more effective them llama guard as if the model knows it people will always find a way around the guards the real solution is making sure the model just doesn't know the harmful knowledge or is specifically trained against revealing it.",fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,machine-learning,[],,19

So we initially look at homonyms which come in two kinds homophones or two lemmas that sounds the same with different meanings or homographs two lemmas that are spelt the same with different meanings.  

Next we have the concept of polysemy which basically just means a single lemma with many different senses or meanings.  

Next we cover metonomy which is like a metaphor, one word or lemma being used in place of another due to similar meaning or content as they are usually related concepts think building bank example.

The main things I hadn’t seen before were t-distribution and chi squared distribution which also brought with them the concept of degrees of freedom.
The idea here is t distribution is used for real small samples of less than 20 working better than the normal dist, the degree of freedom metric allows us to control the mean and variance of the dist.
Usually dof = n-1 so as the number of samples increases we get closer to a normal distribution.  It’s set to n-1 as in order to maintain a specific shape we will have to keep one value dependent on the rest, than known average example. 
Chi squared is another distribution that uses dof as well but its goal is to evaluate how well the observed values fit the expected values or in order words how well a distribution fits the data.  
I like to think of it as complementary to MLE or maximum likelihood estimation where we choose the mean and std of a such that the dist maximises the prob of producing the observed samples.

The second video overviewed the history of data solutions starting with the relational data warehouse, data lake, the combined modern solution using both and finally the newer data lake house solution using delta files.
Today’s video was a great exploration of how to produce a data lake in azure.  We explored the storage account or storage resource there are 4 services within it.
First is the blob storage but in its base form it is no hierarchical until you activate the hierarchical namespace then it acts as a true data lake then you can use it for normal file storage like images or other files etc in normal mode. 
The table service acts as a no sql database with is also cool and useful the advanced version being cosmos.
Next was the file service which allowed file storage and sync as well as file sharing which is nice.
Then last was the Queue which is used as a buffer for endpoints where file processing is necessary. 
So yeah a great lesson and in the end we will be using Blob service with the hierarchical namespace added to make it a data lake.  Also blob stands for Binary Large OBject which is cool to remember. ",fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,azure-data-engineer,[],,92

d8f7293e-e08b-4177-8610-ed52ee31f931,29/10/2024,Cross Browser Compatibility Solved,"Today with some help from Angus I figured out that the issue I was having with the website displaying differently on different browsers and devices was because different browsers have different engines that have different css support.

My main issue was using justify self center which only works on chrome and edge.  So I used a website called caniuse.com which was super helpful and allowed me to solve the issue by just wrapping the item in a flex box div and doing a justify centre to get same result.

I also figured out that the text colours will also have different defaults between browsers so I made sure to explicitly say the text colours I wanted and this helped to resolve the issue completely.

Next steps are figuring out the menu margin issue as well as adding authentication then it’s just adding in the other types of pages and more features,  this is super exciting and I am excited to see where I can take this project",fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,project-progress,[],,38

We first looked at the 4 different types of storage redundancy LRS, ZRS, GRS and GZRS.  In order of increased protection as well as price.
Today’s lesson was on different dotage tiers that being hot, cool, cold and archived and the differences between their storage cost and access costs. We looked how archive is offline and takes hours to come back online and costly.
We also looked at the rules you can add to move files based on file age and how their is expected times before a file can be moved without extra fine. 
We looked at advanced rules that can ch age file types based on usage as well which costs more.
Finally we looked at how we can estimate service and resource pricing in general with the azure price estimator tool which is super helpful",fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,azure-data-engineer,[],,99

It's actually that when all the inputs are tokenised and positionally encoded, a matrix is dynamically generated to have the exact length to contain all of the inputs and then this matrix becomes the basis for the attention operations.

Remember transformers and attention solve all of the problems with RNNs that being context lost and slow training while also allowing better relationships to be learn between any of the input words with each other not limited to words close to each other.

f1070c23-84c4-4c3e-9845-2390d114ea3b,5/11/2024,Sliding Window,"Today I failed at my daily algorithm question.  The reason why I failed was because of two main reason.  I initially only considered the two pointer method in applications like palindromes.  

But if you think of the two pointer technique as a sliding window with left and right pointers this concept can be very powerful in order to solve problems.  The other reason I failed was I forgot that I only had time complexity and if so I can use as much space complexity a so like.  It’s also usually better to start using more resources then simplify as opposed to finding next solution right away.  

Think about this in life and machine learning or design.  In the real world you start with a good guesstimate then refine over time as opposed to trying to find the best solution right away. 


The way to solve the problem I was given which was to find smallest substring in S that contains all of chars from T.  We use the sliding window method.

Initially we iterate through T to get a hash map of all char counts and total length.  

Next we look at the S string with our window l and r staring at 0 and 0 we step r adding the new value to a new hash map representing what we have seen  and the counts.  We keep stepping forward until we have all chars in t covered with right counts we then save this substring and keep moving once we have too many of a char we step the back l forward to try and make the window smaller.  When we don’t have enough we move forward.  

By the end we just choose the shortest of the substrings we got",fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,machine-learning,[],,63
f2ee88a1-eef0-4e0e-9456-5fa31e77064b,6/11/2024,Dual Array Algorithm Approach,"Today I was doing my algorithm again and failed yet again which is great!  It's a sign of me putting in my 10,000 hours and really learning something new my brain didn't have the ability to figure out on it's own before.
The problem was that you have an array nums, and you want to create the answer array and for i in nums answer[i] = product of all values in the array except i.
Initially, this seemed easy through the use of a single pass to determine the total product of everything followed by a second pass dividing all by i to get the result. However the solution said that division was not allowed.
So the way this is solved is very clever we initially start calculating the product to the left of every value in nums.
We can cleverly do this in just one pass, storing first value as 1, then next in array as left[i] = left[i-1] * nums[i-1].  Then we just repeat the process starting at the right end and moving back to the beginning. 
From here we can use these two final arrays to get our result  it is s very clever solution to the problem.  Also we can use the length of left to get the length of right so we can fill it in from the end making our solution better.

fd4d3d82-3296-41d4-b556-bd1641d70549,26/11/2024,Multiple Linear Regressions,"Today I better understand why people used to say that a neural network is the same as multiple linear regressions. 
This is because a linear regression is just essentially a weighted sum in N dimensions, so if we visualise the result, it is just a straight line in n dimensions. 
The neuron of a NN also has the exact same weighted sum equation prior to be passing through the activation function.
This also allows me to better understand what is going on here as the activation function ensures the output is non-linear therefore without it the neurons would just be a combination of linear equations resulting in just another linear equation.
But by using activation functions we now are combining many non-linear functions so the output and overall combination is able to take on a much more complex shape.
Because at the end of the day we are just building a function approximator and trying to brute force a complex relationship and the move complexity we are able to add allows us to better capture complex relationships.
This is why it is so good at NLP and CV tasks as the data is unstructured and contains complex relationships. As opposed to structured data which is usually more linear which is why things like gradient boosters usually work better there.",fbc72f17-b191-48a6-86ab-54ed20be6cf1,machine-learning,[],,122
