My personal blog website I can use to track my personal progress and ideas as well as my projects and think I am learning.

I will also apply and implement NLP and LLM components for the ability to easily search for and perform RAG on my posts in order to query my thoughts and learnings.

I want to also add ai generated post summarises and have the ability to store images so I can save code snippets to see later when I face a sinilar problem. 

I really also want to use this as a way to save important code snippets I want to remeber for use later so I don't need to alwyas search things up that I use a lot.
