# Stormdrain
My personal blog website I can use to track my personal progress and ideas as well as my projects and think I am learning.

This project has taught me a lot about fullstack development inlcuding more challenging concepts such as implementing cookie authentication adn serversie session authentication leveraging supabase.  I have also had to learn about ssr and optimising client and serveside rendering.

I have also implemented ai summaries as well as vector search and indexing for retrieval augmened generation on my blog posts allowing me to query what I have learnt about certain topics or specific things I have done etc!

This project taught me so much and I am excited to take what I have learned and apply it to future projects.
