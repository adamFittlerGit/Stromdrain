My personal blog website I can use to track my personal progress and ideas as well as my projects and think I am learning.

I will also apply and implement NLP and LLM components for the ability to easily search for and perform RAG on my posts in order to query my thoughts and learnings.

I want to also add ai generated post summarises and have the ability to store images so I can save code snippets to see later when I face a sinilar problem.
